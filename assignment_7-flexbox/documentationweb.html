        <h4 id="item-1">HTML(Hypertext markup language)</h4>
        <p>
          HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not
          officially released. It was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01
          was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML. HTML is a
          very evolving markup language and has evolved with various versions
          updating. Long before its revised standards and specifications are
          carried in, each version has allowed its user to create web pages in a
          much easier and prettier way and make sites very efficient. HTML 1.0
          was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that
          can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not many of the
          developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was
          also not growing. Then comes HTML 2.0, published in 1995, which
          contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional
          features, which remained as the standard markup language for designing
          and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core
          features of HTML. Then comes HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett introduced a
          fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of
          HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing
          web pages. But these powerful features of the new HTML slowed down the
          browser in applying further improvements. Then comes HTML 4.01, which
          is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0,
          which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for
          an extended version of HTML 4.01, which was published in the year
          2012.

        <h5 id="item-2">CSS(Cascading style sheet)</h5>
        <p>
          CSS is one of three cornerstone technologies used on the web (the
          other two are HTML and JavaScript). CSS stands for Cascading Style
          Sheets – the clues are really in the words ‘cascading’ and ‘style’
          with cascading describing the way that one style can cascade from one
          to another. One of the many benefits of CSS is that more than one
          style can be used within one HTML document. CSS is used as a way of
          defining how HTML code is going to look on a website. Whereas HTML
          (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create content, including
          written text, CSS alters the way a web page will look. So, depending
          on the data they want to display, a developer might choose to have a
          page with tabs running across the top of the page, or along the side.
          Or, another developer might choose to use headings and sub heading
          styles to ensure that the words leap off the page or, change or revamp
          an existing webpage entirely. Perhaps the best way of describing what
          CSS does is to explain what a page would like if it didn’t use CSS.
          Without CSS web pages are plain and far from inspirational. Words
          scroll across the whole page and are difficult to read. But, before
          CSS that’s exactly what web pages looked like. The introduction of CSS
          is partly responsible for how the web looks and feels today. And, far
          from being created and therefore finished, it is a continually
          evolving language.
        </p>
        <h5 id="item-3">JS(Java Script)</h5>
        <p>
          JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in
          1995. Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as a scripting language
          for use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator.
          Initially known as LiveScript, Netscape changed the name to JavaScript
          so they could position it as a companion for the Java language, a
          product of their partner, Sun Microsystems. Apart from some
          superficial syntactic similarities, though, JavaScript is in no way
          related to the Java programming language. After its release, more and
          more browsers started adding JavaScript support. Still, for much of
          its history JavaScript was not regarded as a serious programming
          language. Its earliest releases suffered from notable performance and
          security issues, but developers had no alternatives. If they wanted to
          run programs in the browser, they had to use JavaScript. In 2008, the
          creation of Google's open-source Chrome V8, a high-performance
          JavaScript engine, provided a crucial turning point for JavaScript.
          The subsequent proliferation of fast JavaScript engines made it
          possible for developers to build sophisticated browser-based
          applications with performance that competed with desktop and mobile
          applications. Soon after, Ryan Dahl released an open-source,
          cross-platform environment called Node.js. It provided a way to run
          JavaScript code from outside a browser. It freed JavaScript from the
          browser's confines and led directly to JavaScript's current
          popularity. Today, you can use JavaScript to write all kinds of
          applications, including browser, server, mobile, and desktop
          applications. Most major online companies today, including Facebook,
          Twitter, Netflix, and Google, all use JavaScript in their products.
        </p>
        <h4 id="item-4">Bootstrap</h4>
        <p>
          Originally created by a designer and a developer at Twitter, Bootstrap
          has become one of the most popular front-end frameworks and open
          source projects in the world. Bootstrap was created at Twitter in
          mid-2010 by @mdo and @fat. Prior to being an open-sourced framework,
          Bootstrap was known as Twitter Blueprint. A few months into
          development, Twitter held its first Hack Week and the project exploded
          as developers of all skill levels jumped in without any external
          guidance. It served as the style guide for internal tools development
          at the company for over a year before its public release, and
          continues to do so today. Originally released on August 19, 2011,
          we’ve since had over twenty releases, including two major rewrites
          with v2 and v3. With Bootstrap 2, we added responsive functionality to
          the entire framework as an optional stylesheet. Building on that with
          Bootstrap 3, we rewrote the library once more to make it responsive by
          default with a mobile first approach.

        <h4 id="item-5">Material Design</h4>
        <p>
          Material Design (codenamed Quantum Paper)[5] is a design language
          developed by Google in 2014. Expanding on the "cards" that debuted in
          Google Now, Material Design uses more grid-based layouts, responsive
          animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as
          lighting and shadows. Google announced Material Design on June 25,
          2014, at the 2014 Google I/O conference. The main purpose of Material
          Design is the creation of a new visual language that combines
          principles of good design with technical and scientific innovation.
          Designer Matías Duarte explained that, "unlike real paper, our digital
          material can expand and reform intelligently. Material has physical
          surfaces and edges. Seams and shadows provide meaning about what you
          can touch." Google states that their new design language is based on
          paper and ink but implementation takes place in an advanced
          manner.[6][7][8] In 2018, Google detailed a revamp of the language,
          with a focus on providing more flexibility for designers to create
          custom "themes" with varying geometry, colors, and typography. Google
          released Material Theme Editor exclusively for the macOS design
          application

        <h5 id="item-6">React</h5>
        <p>
          React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source
          front-end JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces based on
          UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a
          community of individual developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can
          be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or
          server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However,
          React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state
          to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of
          additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side
          functionality.[7][8]

        <h5 id="item-7">Angular</h5>
        <p>
          Angular (commonly[citation needed] referred to as "Angular 2+")[4] is
          a TypeScript-based free and open-source web application framework led
          by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and
          corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that
          built AngularJS. Differences between Angular and AngularJS
          Architecture of an Angular application. The main building blocks are
          modules, components, templates, metadata, data binding, directives,
          services, and dependency injection. Google designed Angular as a
          ground-up rewrite of AngularJS. Angular does not have a concept of
          "scope" or controllers; instead, it uses a hierarchy of components as
          its primary architectural characteristic.[5] Angular has a different
          expression syntax, focusing on "[ ]" for property binding, and "( )"
          for event binding[6] Modularity – much core functionality has moved to
          modules Angular recommends the use of Microsoft's TypeScript language,
          which introduces the following features: Static typing, including
          Generics Annotations Dynamic loading Asynchronous template

        <h5 id="item-8">Node JS</h5>
        <p>
          Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime
          environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code
          outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network
          applications. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command
          line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side
          to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the
          user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript
          everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a
          single programming language, rather than different languages for
          server-side and client-side scripts. Node.js has an event-driven
          architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to
          optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many
          input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications
          (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).[7] The
          Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the
          Node.js Foundation,[8] and has now merged with the JS Foundation to
          form the OpenJS Foundation, which is facilitated by the Linux
          Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.[9]

        <h5 id="item-9">Next JS</h5>
        <p>
          Next.js is an open-source web development framework built on top of
          Node.js enabling React-based web applications functionalities such as
          server-side rendering and generating static websites. React
          documentation mentions Next.js among "Recommended Toolchains" advising
          it to developers as a solution when "Building a server-rendered
          website with Node.js".[4] Where traditional React apps can only render
          their content in the client-side browser, Next.js extends this
          functionality to include applications rendered on the server-side. The
          copyright and trademarks for Next.js are owned by Vercel, formerly
          ZEIT,[5] which also maintains and leads its open-source
          development.[6]

        <h5 id="item-10">Java (programming language)</h5>
        <p>
          Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming
          language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies
          as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to
          let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that
          compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without
          the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to
          bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of
          the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to
          C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The
          Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and
          runtime code modification) that are typically not available in
          traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most
          popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20]
          particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9
          million developers.[21] Java was originally developed by James Gosling
          at Sun Microsystems and released in May 1995 as a core component of
          Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference
          implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries
          were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May
          2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community
          Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the
          GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual
          Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK
          JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and
          is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions. As of March
          2022, Java 18 is the latest version, while Java 17, 11 and 8 are the
          current long-term support (LTS) versions. Oracle released the last
          zero-cost public update for the legacy version Java 8 LTS in January
          2019 for commercial use, although it will otherwise still support Java
          8 with public updates for personal use indefinitely. Other vendors
          have begun to offer zero-cost builds of OpenJDK 18 and 8, 11 and 17
          that are still receiving security and other upgrades

        <h5 id="item-11">Python (programming language)</h5>
        <p>
          Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming
          language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the
          use of significant indentation.[31] Python is dynamically-typed and
          garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
          including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and
          functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries
          included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[32][33]
          Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a
          successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in
          1991 as Python 0.9.0.[34] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and
          introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting
          garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python
          3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely
          backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued
          with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[35] Python consistently ranks as one of
          the most popular programming languages.[36

        <h5 id="item-12">PHP</h5>
        <p>
          PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web
          development.[7] It was originally created by Danish-Canadian
          programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.[8] The PHP reference implementation
          is now produced by The PHP Group.[9] PHP originally stood for Personal
          Home Page,[8] but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP:
          Hypertext Preprocessor.[10] PHP code is usually processed on a web
          server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a
          Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result
          of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which may be any type of
          data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the
          whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web
          content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be
          employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response.
          Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the
          web context, such as standalone graphical applications[11] and robotic
          drone control.[12] PHP code can also be directly executed from the
          command line. The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend
          Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been
          widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of
          operating systems and platforms.[13] The PHP language evolved without
          a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the
          original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other
          implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to
          create a formal PHP specification.[14] W3Techs reports that, as of
          January 2022, "PHP is used by 78.1% of all the websites whose
          server-side programming language we know."[15] PHP version 7.4 is the
          most used version. Support for version 7.3 was dropped on 6 December
          2021.

        <h5 id="item-14">VB.Net</h5>
        <p>
          In computing, a compiler is a computer program that translates
          computer code written in one programming language (the source
          language) into another language (the target language). The name
          "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate source code
          from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g.
          assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an
          executable program.[1][2]: p1 [3] There are many different types of
          compilers which produce output in different useful forms. A
          cross-compiler produces code for a different CPU or operating system
          than the one on which the cross-compiler itself runs. A bootstrap
          compiler is often a temporary compiler, used for compiling a more
          permanent or better optimised compiler for a language. Related
          software include, a program that translates from a low-level language
          to a higher level one is a decompiler ; a program that translates
          between high-level languages, usually called a source-to-source
          compiler or transpiler. A language rewriter is usually a program that
          translates the form of expressions without a change of language. A
          compiler-compiler is a compiler that produces a compiler (or part of
          one), often in a generic and reusable way so as to be able to produce
          many differing compilers. A compiler is likely to perform some or all
          of the following operations, often called phases: preprocessing,
          lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis (syntax-directed
          translation), conversion of input programs to an intermediate
          representation, code optimization and code generation. Compilers
          generally implement these phases as modular components, promoting
          efficient design and correctness of transformations of source input to
          target output. Program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior
          can be very difficult to track down and work around; therefore,
          compiler implementers invest significant effort to ensure compiler
          correctness.[4] Compilers are not the only language processor used to
          transform source programs. An interpreter is computer software that
          transforms and then executes the indicated operations.[2]: p2  The
          translation process influences the design of computer languages, which
          leads to a preference of compilation or interpretation. In theory, a
          programming language can have both a compiler and an interpreter. In
          practice, programming languages tend to be associated with just one (a
          compiler or an interpreter).
        </p>
        <h5 id="item-15">Perl</h5>
        <p>
          Perl is a family of two high-level, general-purpose, interpreted,
          dynamic programming languages. "Perl" refers to Perl 5, but from 2000
          to 2019 it also referred to its redesigned "sister language", Perl 6,
          before the latter's name was officially changed to Raku in October
          2019.[9][10] Though Perl is not officially an acronym,[11] there are
          various backronyms in use, including "Practical Extraction and
          Reporting Language".[12] Perl was developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a
          general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing
          easier.[13] Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions.
          Raku, which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually evolved
          into a separate language. Both languages continue to be developed
          independently by different development teams and liberally borrow
          ideas from each other. The Perl languages borrow features from other
          programming languages including C, sh, AWK, and sed;[14] They provide
          text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of
          many contemporary Unix command line tools.[15] Perl 5 gained
          widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language,
          in part due to its powerful regular expression and string parsing
          abilities.[16][17][18][19] In addition to CGI, Perl 5 is used for
          system administration, network programming, finance, bioinformatics,
          and other applications, such as for GUIs. It has been nicknamed "the
          Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages" because of its flexibility
          and power,[20] and also what some consider ugliness[21] due to its
          utilization of more special characters than many other languages. In
          1998, it was also referred to as the "duct tape that holds the
          Internet together," in reference to both its ubiquitous use as a glue
          language and its perceived inelegance.[22] Perl is a highly expressive
          programming language: source code for a given algorithm can be short
          and highly compressible.[23

        <h5 id="item-16">Ruby</h5>
        <p>
          Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming
          language which supports multiple programming paradigms. It was
          designed with an emphasis on programming productivity and simplicity.
          In Ruby, everything is an object, including primitive data types. It
          was developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.
          Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection and just-in-time
          compilation. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
          procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. According to
          the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada,
          BASIC, and Lisp.[11][3]

        <h5 id="item-17">C (programming language)</h5>
        <p>
          C (/ˈsiː/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose computer
          programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie,
          and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features
          cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found
          lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks,
          though decreasingly for application software, and is common in
          computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to
          the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems. A successor to the
          programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by
          Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on
          Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix
          operating system.[6] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity.
          It has become one of the most widely used programming languages,[7][8]
          with C compilers available for almost[citation needed] all modern
          computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized
          by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for
          Standardization (ISO). C is an imperative procedural language
          supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and
          recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled
          to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map
          efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support.
          Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to
          encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program
          written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of
          computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its
          source code.[9] Since 2000, C has consistently ranked among the top
          two languages in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of
          programming languages.[10]

        <h5 id="item-18">C++ (programming language)</h5>
        <p>
          C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language
          created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension
          of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has
          expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has
          object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to
          facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always
          implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++
          compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft,
          Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.[10] C++
          was designed with an orientation toward systems programming and
          embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with
          performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design
          highlights.[11] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts,
          with key strengths being software infrastructure and
          resource-constrained applications,[11] including desktop applications,
          video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and
          performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space
          probes).[12] C++ is standardized by the International Organization for
          Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and
          published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally
          known as C++20).[13] The C++ programming language was initially
          standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by
          the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20
          standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard
          library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed
          by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C
          language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C
          that also provided high-level features for program organization.[14]
          Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release schedule[15] with
          C++23 as the next planned standard.[16]
